"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 03/17/02 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  Economic activity in the advanced and emerging economies has continued to improve. Global trade is also showing a recovery. In this environment, the Asian economies are benefiting from stronger external demand amid sustained domestic activity. For 2017, the global economy is projected to expand at a slightly faster pace. Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, heightened volatility of financial markets and negative developments in the prices of key commodities.   Despite the challenging global and domestic environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 4.2% in 2016. Growth was underpinned by private sector activity, with additional support from the turnaround in net exports. The growth momentum is expected to be sustained in 2017. With the growth of domestic demand being sustained, the more positive contribution from the external sector will lead to a better performance of the Malaysian economy.   Headline inflation is projected to be higher in 2017, reflecting primarily the pass-through impact of the increase in global oil prices on domestic retail fuel prices. Headline inflation would remain relatively high in the first half of the year before moderating thereafter. However, the projected trajectory of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on the future trend in global oil prices which remains highly uncertain. The cost-driven inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions. Core inflation is expected to increase modestly.  The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has continued to stabilise. The implementation of financial market development measures has had a positive impact on the domestic financial markets. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.  1/2  11/21/2020",2017-03-02
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 03/20/01 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively.  Global economic conditions have weakened in the recent period. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted production and travel activity, especially within the region. This has also led to greater risk aversion, resulting in tighter financial conditions and a resurgence in financial market volatility. Downside risks to the global growth outlook have increased, particularly in the near term. However, a number of countries have implemented policy responses. With further anticipated policy measures, these actions are expected to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19.  The Malaysian economy grew at a moderate pace of 4.3% in 2019. Looking ahead, growth, particularly in the first quarter, will be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak primarily in the tourism-related and manufacturing sectors. The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter. For 2020, private and public sector activities will be supportive of growth. Household spending is expected to grow at a slower pace amid moderate employment and income growth. Investment activity is projected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors. The 2020 economic stimulus package will also provide some support to economic activity. Although domestic growth is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, there are key downside risks, mainly stemming from the evolving nature and prolonged impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and continued weakness in commodity-related sectors.  In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings. Underlying inflation is expected to be more moderate, amid limited demand pressures despite the continued expansion in economic activity.  The reduction in the OPR is intended to provide a more accommodative monetary environment to support the projected improvement in economic growth amid price stability. The MPC will  1/2  11/21/2020  continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2020-03-03
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 03/19/01 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  Global growth momentum is showing signs of moderation amid slowing growth in most major advanced and emerging economies. Going forward, unresolved trade tensions remain a key source of risk, affecting global trade and investment activities. Tighter global financial conditions and elevated political and policy uncertainty could lead to financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook.  The Malaysian economy grew at a more moderate pace of 4.7% in 2018. Looking ahead, growth is expected to be sustained in 2019 with continued support from private sector spending. Stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending. Support from the external sector is expected to soften, in tandem with the moderating global growth momentum. On balance, the baseline forecast is for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path. However, materialisation of downside risks from unresolved trade tensions, heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and prolonged weakness in the commodity-related sectors could further weigh on growth.   Headline inflation in January 2019 was at -0.7%, due mainly to negative transport inflation at -7.8% arising from lower global oil prices.  Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation[1] remained stable at 1.5% in January 2019 reflecting sustained demand conditions. In the immediate term, inflation is expected to remain low mainly due to policy measures. These include the lower price ceiling on domestic retail fuel prices until mid-2019 and the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy on headline inflation.  For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018. The trajectory of headline inflation will continue to be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to be sustained, supported by the steady expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures.  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. Recognising that there are downside risks in the economic and  1/2  11/21/2020  financial environment, the MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.     [1] Core inflation is computed by excluding price-volatile and price-administered items. It also excludes the estimated direct impact of tax policy changes.",2019-03-05
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 11/19/01 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy is expanding at a more moderate pace, with the slowdown becoming more synchronised across both the advanced and emerging economies. There is also evidence of the weak global trade affecting domestic demand, particularly investment activity. Going forward, geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty and the unresolved trade disputes could exacerbate financial market volatility and further weigh on the global growth outlook. Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support to growth.  For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators are in line with expectations, suggesting moderate expansion of economic activity for the third quarter. Going forward, growth is expected to remain anchored by firm private sector expenditure. While private investment is projected to remain modest, household spending will be supported by continued employment and wage growth. The recent Government measures will provide additional impetus to economic activity. On the external front, while exports will continue to be affected by slower global demand, this will be partly mitigated by its diversified structure. Overall, growth of the Malaysian economy is expected to be within projections in 2019 and the pace sustained going into 2020. This projection remains subject to downside risks, mainly stemming from uncertainties in global economic and financial conditions as well as weakness in commodity- related sectors.  Average headline inflation in 2019 will be low. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. This reflects mainly the lapse in the impact from consumption tax policy changes, the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceiling amid the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and measures in place to contain food prices. The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures.  At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable growth amid price stability.  1/2  11/21/2020  The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2020. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 09/18/02 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.   The global economic expansion is continuing, albeit with increasing divergence across economies and signs of a slower momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will remain underpinned by strong labour market conditions and policy support. In Asia, growth will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand. Although global growth is currently sustained, risks to growth have increased. Trade tensions continue to be a key source of downside risk. Greater volatility in the international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies.   For Malaysia, supply disruptions in the mining and agriculture sectors led to more moderate growth in the second quarter of 2018. On the demand side, growth remained supported by private sector activity with further impetus from net exports. Looking ahead, private consumption, which was boosted by the tax holiday, will continue to be driven by steady wage and employment growth. Investment activity is projected to be underpinned by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, particularly in the export-oriented industries, driven by favourable demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending however is expected to weigh on growth as the Government embarks on reprioritisation of expenditure. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. In the immediate term, the economy faces downside risks stemming from heightened trade tensions, prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors and some domestic policy uncertainty. On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path.   Headline inflation was at 0.9% in July 2018. Going forward and continuing into 2019, headline inflation is expected to edge upwards taking into consideration the impact of policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of the changes in the consumption tax policy on headline inflation will be transitory and lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is nevertheless expected to remain relatively stable.   In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-  1/2  11/21/2020  resident portfolio outflows due to ongoing global developments. Despite these adjustments, domestic financial markets remain resilient with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth. The financial sector remains sound, with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. In addition, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and current account surplus of the balance of payments. Bank Negara Malaysia’s monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity.   At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2018-09-05
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 03/18/02 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  The global economy continues to strengthen. Global trade is showing strong growth momentum. In the advanced economies, rising wages and policy support will provide further impetus to growth. In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Recent adjustments in the financial markets, though short-lived, indicate that volatility may reemerge. Trade tensions have also risen in the recent period. At this point, risks to the global growth outlook remain balanced, pointing towards continuity in global economic expansion.  For Malaysia, the strong growth performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be anchored by private sector spending. Looking ahead, growth prospects will be sustained by the positive global growth outlook and spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions, spending on new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. With additional impetus from the external sector, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018.  Inflation is projected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018, but at a more moderate pace relative to the previous year. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is also projected to moderate due to improving labour productivity and ongoing investments for capacity expansion.  The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The broad appreciation of the ringgit in the past year better reflects the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity.  1/2  11/21/2020  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid lower inflation.

The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively.   The global economy continues to expand moderately. While growth outcomes for several major economies were better than expected during the first quarter, underlying economic conditions continue to suggest moderation going forward. Considerable downside risks to global growth remain, stemming from unresolved trade tensions and prolonged country- specific weaknesses in the major economies, further dampening global trade and investment activities. Although the tightening in global financial conditions has eased somewhat, heightened policy uncertainties could lead to sharp financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook.   For Malaysia, latest developments point towards moderate economic activity in the first quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, slowing global demand conditions and subdued growth of key trading partners will continue to weigh on the external sector. Domestically, stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending. The baseline projection is for the Malaysian economy to grow within the projected range of 4.3% - 4.8%. However, there are downside risks to growth from heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors.   Headline inflation increased to 0.2% in March 2019 (February: -0.4%), due mainly to the less negative transport inflation at -3.0% (February: -6.8%). Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation[1], remained stable at 1.6% in March 2019. In the immediate term, inflation is expected to remain low mainly due to policy measures. These include the price ceiling on domestic retail fuel prices until mid-2019 and the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy on headline inflation. For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018. The trajectory of headline inflation will continue to be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures.    1/2  11/21/2020  The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite periods of volatility primarily due to global developments. While domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth, there are some signs of tightening of financial conditions.

This is consistent with the monetary policy stance of supporting a steady growth path amid price stability.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 09/16/03 /   /     At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Growth across the advanced economies has been modest. In Asia, economic activity has been supported by domestic demand amid weaker export growth. While volatility in the international financial markets has subsided, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments. Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom.  For Malaysia, growth moderated slightly in the second quarter of the year, following weaker net exports and a drawdown in stocks. Domestic demand, however, remained the key driver of growth, with private consumption and private investment growing at a faster pace. Going forward, private consumption will remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced Government measures to increase disposable income. Investment activity will continue to be anchored by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, export growth is expected to remain weak following subdued demand from Malaysia’s key trading partners. Overall, the economy is projected to expand within expectations in 2016, and to remain on a steady growth path in 2017.  Headline inflation moderated to 1.1% in July. Inflation is expected to be at the lower end of the 2 to 3% range for 2016 and to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation.  Domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. Banking system liquidity remains ample.  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy.  1/2  11/21/2020  The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.

The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across countries. Global trade has picked up significantly. In the advanced economies, both consumption and investment continue to improve. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. These developments point to sustained momentum in global growth. This outlook nevertheless may be affected by political and policy developments in major economies and geopolitical risks.  The Malaysian economy recorded a higher growth in the second quarter of 2017, driven by firmer domestic activity and exports. Looking ahead, growth prospects will be sustained by the more positive global growth outlook and stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, supported by improving incomes and overall labour market conditions, new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, growth in 2017 will be stronger than earlier expected.  Headline inflation continued its moderating trend, declining to 3.2% in July, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices. Going forward, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained.  The domestic financial markets have been resilient.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 11/18/03 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  The global economic expansion continues, although with signs of moderating momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will continue to be mainly driven by positive labour market conditions and policy support. Growth in Asia will be supported by domestic activity amid weaker external demand. Risks to the global growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, with trade tensions continuing to be a key source of downside risk. Continued volatility in international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in some advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies.  For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity. Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by conducive labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be sustained by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, driven by positive demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending, however, is likely to weigh on growth, amid continued reprioritisation of expenditure by the Government. The recent announcements by the Government have provided more clarity on fiscal and economic development policies. On the external front, exports are projected to provide an additional lift to growth, albeit to a lesser extent, due to moderating global growth momentum. The domestic economy continues to face downside risks stemming from any further escalation in trade tensions and prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors. Nevertheless, on balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2018 and 2019.   The annual average headline inflation will be low in 2018. Moving into 2019, headline inflation is projected to increase primarily due to higher projected global oil prices and the floating of domestic fuel prices. While the impact of the consumption tax policy will contribute to higher headline inflation in 2019, it will lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures.  In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non- resident portfolio outflows due to global developments. Nevertheless, the financial markets remain orderly with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth.  1/2  11/21/2020  The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers.

The global economy continues to expand moderately. Labour conditions in the advanced economies remain firm, while domestic demand continues to support growth in Asia. Leading indicators, however, point to a softening of the near term global economic outlook, with considerable downside risks remaining primarily from prolonged trade tensions. While the prospects of monetary easing in the major economies have somewhat eased global financial conditions, heightened policy uncertainty could lead to excessive financial market volatility.    The Malaysian economy grew within expectations in the first quarter of the year, supported by both domestic and external factors. Looking ahead, while the external sector performance is likely to be weighed down by slower global growth and trade tensions, economic growth will be supported by domestic demand. Household and capital spending will continue to be driven by stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors such as manufacturing and services. The baseline projection remains within the range of 4.3% - 4.8%. This projection, however, is subject to downside risks from ongoing uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, worsening trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors.  While headline inflation has remained low in the recent period, it is projected to rise in the coming months as the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy lapses.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 11/17/05 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy continues to strengthen. Growth has become more entrenched and synchronised across regions. Global trade has picked up significantly. Amid the sustained growth performance, economic slack is diminishing in the advanced economies. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Financial markets have also been relatively calm in the recent period. For 2018, the global economy is projected to experience sustained growth. While there are risks arising from geopolitical and policy developments in major economies, economic prospects are expected to remain favourable.  For Malaysia, economic growth has become more entrenched. Both the domestic and external sectors continue to register strong performance. Growth momentum has been lifted by stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy as firms invest in productive capacity, raise wages and hire more workers. For 2018, domestic demand is expected to remain the key source of growth. Private consumption will remain the largest driver of growth, supported by continued improvements in income and overall labour market conditions. Investment will be sustained by infrastructure projects and higher capital investment in the manufacturing and services sectors. The external sector will provide additional impetus to the economy. Overall, the assessment is for growth to remain strong in 2018.  Domestic inflation has been driven mostly by movements in global oil prices. Consequently, headline inflation increased to 4.3% in September, arising from higher global prices of refined oil caused by disruptions in the global supply. For 2017 as a whole, headline inflation is expected to be at the upper end of the forecast range. Moving into 2018, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. Nevertheless, the trend of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by robust domestic demand.  The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial  1/2  11/21/2020  institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. Given the strength of the global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee may consider reviewing the current degree of monetary accommodation. This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy.  The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2018.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 05/18/03 /   /     At its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, the MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  The global economy continues to gain strength with growth being more broad based and synchronised across regions. Global trade sustained its strong momentum. In the advanced economies, higher wages and diminishing labour market slack remain supportive of growth. Additional policy support, particularly in the US, is expected to lift growth further. In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Financial markets continue to face intermittent volatility amid rising trade tensions. Global growth prospects remain balanced although there are risks should trade and geopolitical tensions worsen.  For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity and exports. Going forward, the positive growth momentum is expected to be sustained, driven by the strength in both domestic and external demand. Private consumption will be supported by favourable income and labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be sustained by implementation of ongoing infrastructure projects and capacity expansion by firms. On the external front, exports are expected to continue benefitting from the positive momentum in global growth and trade in advanced and regional economies. Overall, the prospects for the Malaysian economy remain strong.  Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the year as a whole on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is projected to remain moderate amid stable demand conditions.  Despite financial market volatility due to external developments, domestic financial markets have remained resilient. Malaysia’s economic fundamentals are strongly anchored. The domestic economic outlook remains positive, the financial sector is strong and monetary and financial conditions are supportive of economic growth in the post-election environment.  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path  1/2  11/21/2020  amid lower inflation. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2018-05-10
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 07/18/02 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  The global economy continues to expand albeit with some divergence across economies while global trade sustained its growth momentum. In the advanced economies, rising income and policy support, particularly in the US, will continue to drive growth. Growth in Asia will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand. However, the balance of risks to the outlook has tilted to the downside. The intensification of global trade tensions could affect sentiments and weigh on trade, investment and consumption. Coupled with ongoing monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies, shifting investor expectations and sentiments could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in some emerging economies.  The Malaysian economy continued to expand in the first half of 2018, supported by private sector activity with additional impetus from net exports. The positive growth performance is expected to be sustained, driven by both domestic and external demand. Private consumption will be underpinned by continued wage and employment growth, with an additional lift from higher household spending due to the tax holiday. Investment activity is projected to be supported by capacity expansion mainly in the export-oriented industries and ongoing infrastructure projects, particularly in the transport and utilities sub-sectors. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. The growth outlook will be further supported with greater certainty in domestic policy in the coming months. Overall, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path.  Headline inflation for 2018 is projected to be lower than earlier forecast taking into consideration the impact of recent policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of these measures on inflation, however, is transitory. Headline inflation is likely to turn negative in some months and remain low in the first half of 2019 before trending upwards as these transitory effects lapse. Core inflation is nevertheless expected to remain relatively stable in line with sustained domestic demand.  The positive domestic economic outlook, sound financial sector and improving current account surplus of the balance of payments will continue to support Malaysia’s fundamentals. Domestic financial markets have remained resilient despite non-resident portfolio outflows. The ringgit  1/2  11/21/2020  exchange rate would be more reflective of the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede. Notwithstanding the heightened financial market volatility, the domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia’s monetary operations continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2018-07-11
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 05/17/06 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy continues to expand. Industrial activity and global trade have picked up. Growth is also becoming more synchronised across the advanced and emerging economies. Indicators suggest that the outlook for the global economy will continue to improve. In the advanced economies, the revival in investment is expected to provide additional impetus to economic activity. In the emerging economies, growth is projected to be supported by sustained domestic activity and stronger external demand. Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, and commodity price volatility. These risks could also reignite financial market volatility.  For Malaysia, the growth momentum since the second half of 2016 is expected to strengthen in the first quarter of 2017, and to be sustained for the rest of the year. Growth will be mainly driven by domestic demand amid continued wage and employment growth, and the implementation of new and on-going investment projects. On the external front, given the improvement in global growth, exports are expected to perform more strongly and contribute positively to Malaysia’s economic performance.  Headline inflation increased to 4.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with the MPC’s expectations. The increase in inflation reflected mainly the pass-through impact of higher global oil prices and temporary supply disruptions that led to higher food prices. The higher headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. However, the trend of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. The cost-push inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to increase only modestly.  The ringgit has continued to stabilise. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks  1/2  11/21/2020  surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2017-05-12
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 09/19/02 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.   The global economy is expanding at a more modest pace amid slower growth in most major advanced and emerging economies. The recent escalation of trade tensions point to weaker global trade going forward, with increasing signs of spillovers to domestic economic activity in a number of countries. Monetary policy easing in several major economies has eased global financial conditions, but uncertainty from the prolonged trade disputes and geopolitical developments could lead to excessive financial market volatility.       For Malaysia, the stronger economic growth performance in the second quarter of 2019 was underpinned by the resilience of private spending amid broad-based expansion in key economic sectors. Going forward, these domestic drivers of growth, alongside stable labour market and wage growth, are expected to remain supportive of economic activity. On the external front, Malaysia’s diversified exports will partly mitigate the impact of softening global demand. Overall, the baseline growth projection for 2019 remains unchanged, within the range of 4.3% - 4.8%. This projection, however, is subject to further downside risks from worsening trade tensions, uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors.  Average headline inflation year-to-date is 0.3%. Headline inflation is projected to average higher for the remaining months of the year and into 2020.  However, headline inflation is expected to remain low. This reflects the lapse in the impact of consumption tax policy changes, the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and policy measures in place to contain food prices. The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures.   At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to  1/2  11/21/2020  sustainable growth amid price stability.",2019-09-12
"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 07/16/03 /   /     At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 3.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively.   The global economy continues to record growth at a more moderate pace, across major advanced and emerging market economies. In Asia, persistent weakness in the external sector has weighed on growth, although domestic demand remains supportive. Looking ahead, there are increasing signs of moderating growth momentum in the major economies. Global growth prospects have also become more susceptible to increased downside risks in light of possible repercussions from the EU referendum in the United Kingdom. International financial markets could also be subject to greater volatility going forward. In this light, global monetary conditions are expected to remain highly accommodative.   For Malaysia, domestic demand continues to be the main driver of growth. Private consumption will be supported by growth in income and employment, and measures implemented by the Government. While investment in the oil and gas sector is moderating, overall investment is expected to be supported by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. Exports are projected to remain weak following more subdued demand from Malaysia’s key trading partners. Overall, while the domestic economy remains on track to expand in 2016 and 2017, the uncertainties in the global environment could weigh on Malaysia’s growth prospects.  Inflation was lower as the impact from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implemented in April 2015 lapsed and is expected to remain stable in an environment of low global energy and commodity prices and generally subdued global inflation. Consequently, inflation is projected to be lower at 2 – 3 percent in 2016, compared to an earlier projection of 2.5 – 3.5 percent, and continue to remain stable in 2017.   Overall domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner. The risks of destabilising financial imbalances have receded. Both macro and micro prudential measures as well as supervisory oversight have resulted in more prudent lending standards and contained  1/2  11/21/2020  speculative activities in the property market.   The adjustment to the OPR is intended for the degree of monetary accommodativeness to remain consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 07/17/04 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more synchronised across countries. Industrial activity and global trade are exceeding earlier projections. In the advanced economies, the broad-based increase in investment amid the steady growth in consumption is raising growth prospects. In Asia, growth is expected to be driven by domestic activity and stronger external demand. Risks to the global growth outlook arise mainly from political and policy uncertainties in the major economies, geopolitical and financial market developments, and volatility of commodity prices.  The Malaysian economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2017. Growth was lifted by stronger domestic demand with additional impetus from exports. Going forward, the more favourable global growth prospects will lead to sustained export performance and generate positive spillovers to the domestic economy. Private consumption will be underpinned by higher wages and employment. The improved investment outlook is being driven by new and ongoing infrastructure projects, and stronger capacity expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, the economy is expected to register higher growth in 2017.  Headline inflation moderated to 3.9% in May, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices during the month. Headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year mainly reflecting the waning effect of global cost factors. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained.  The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has remained stable with a more balanced demand and supply of foreign currencies following the implementation of the two financial market development measures. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has improved, consistent with the pace of economic activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 01/17/05 /   /     At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.  The global economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Economic activity in the major advanced economies has improved. In Asia, growth is supported by domestic demand amid some recovery in external demand. For 2017, the global economy is projected to expand at a slightly faster pace. The prospect of a shift towards progressive use of fiscal policy in the developed economies could lead to a more balanced policy environment that would support growth. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainty and downside risks to global growth remain, arising from risks of protectionism, geopolitical developments and commodity price volatility. These risks could also lead to episodes of increased financial market volatility.  For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with support from various policy measures to raise disposable income. Investment activity, although moderating, will be supported by on-going infrastructure development projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, the expected improvement in exports will provide some support to growth. Overall, the economy remains on track to expand as projected.  Headline inflation averaged 2.1% in 2016 and is expected to average higher in 2017, amid the prospect of higher global oil prices. These cost factors are not expected to cause significant spillovers to the broader price trends, given the stable domestic demand conditions. Underlying inflation, as measured by the core inflation index, is therefore expected to remain stable.  The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has seen a reduction in volatility since the sharp adjustments experienced towards the end of 2016. The implementation of financial market development measures has provided stability to the domestic foreign exchange market. Uncertainties in the global economy, the policy environment and geopolitical developments may, however, result in bouts of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets. In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial markets. Banking system liquidity remains  1/2  11/21/2020  ample. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 01/20/03 /   /     At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.00 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively.  The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Latest indicators and the recent dissipation of trade tensions point to improving global trade activity. Monetary easing across major economies in the second half of 2019 has helped ease financial conditions, and is expected to continue to support economic activity. However, downside risks remain due to geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainties in a number of countries. This could cause a resurgence of financial market volatility and weigh on the global growth outlook.  For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators and supply disruptions in commodity-related sectors point to moderate expansion of economic activity in the fourth quarter. For 2019, growth will be within the projected range. For 2020, growth is expected to gradually improve, with continued support from household spending and better export performance. Overall investment activity is expected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors. However, downside risks to growth remain. These include uncertainty from various trade negotiations, geopolitical risks, weaker-than- expected growth of major trade partners, heightened volatility in financial markets, and domestic factors that include weakness in commodity-related sectors and delays in the implementation of projects.   Headline inflation averaged at 0.7% in 2019. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings. Underlying inflation is expected to remain broadly stable, reflecting the continued expansion in economic activity and the absence of strong demand pressures.  The adjustment to the OPR is a pre-emptive measure to secure the improving growth trajectory amid price stability.

The global economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Economic activity in major advanced economies has improved but remains moderate. In Asia, growth has been supported by domestic demand amid persistent weakness in the external sector. Looking ahead, the baseline estimate is for global growth to improve slightly in 2017. The prospect of a shift towards progressive use of fiscal policy in the developed economies could lead to a more balanced policy environment that would support growth going forward. Nevertheless there is uncertainty arising from risks of protectionism and financial market volatility. Heightened financial market volatility in recent weeks has had an adverse effect on various asset classes, exchange rates and yields across many emerging economies. Global financial market conditions are likely to be susceptible to policy and market developments.  The domestic economy continued to expand in the third quarter of the year, driven mainly by private sector activity with some support from net exports. Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with additional support from Government measures to increase disposable income. Investment activity, although moderating, will be supported by on-going infrastructure investments and capital expenditure in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, exports are expected to expand but will be constrained by soft demand from Malaysia’s key trading partners. Overall, the domestic economy remains on track to expand as projected in 2016 and 2017.  Headline inflation for 2016 is expected to be at the lower end of the projected range of 2.0% – 2.5%. Inflation is expected to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation.  The ringgit, along with most emerging market currencies, has experienced sharp adjustments and significant volatility due to continuing uncertainties in global economic and policy environment, and geopolitical developments. These factors could result in periods of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets. In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market. The capital market remains accessible, deep and liquid. Banking system  1/3  11/21/2020  liquidity is ample. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity.  At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The risk of destabilising financial imbalances has been contained. However, the MPC will be monitoring these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects.

"11/21/2020  PRESS RELEASES Monetary Policy Statement Ref No : 01/19/05 /   /        At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.  The global economy continues to expand. Employment remains firm in the advanced economies, while in Asia, domestic demand is sustained. However, global growth momentum is moderating with slower growth in the major economies. Trade tensions are beginning to have a material impact on global trade and investments. Tightening financial conditions and heightened volatility in financial markets, coupled with country-specific factors ranging from heightened political and policy uncertainty and elevated debt levels, could further weigh on growth prospects.  For Malaysia, latest indicators point towards sustained economic expansion. For 2019, domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption will continue to be underpinned by stable employment and wage growth, while private investment will be supported by on-going multi-year projects in both export- and domestic-oriented industries. Sustained growth in private sector activity is expected to offset lower public spending arising from the ongoing fiscal consolidation by the Government. With moderating global growth, the external sector is likely to soften. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside, primarily from potential escalation of trade tensions and commodity-related shocks. On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2019.  Headline inflation averaged at 1.0% in 2018. In 2019, inflation is expected to average moderately higher. The impact of the consumption tax policy on headline inflation in 2019 will start to lapse towards the end of the year. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures.    The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite bouts of volatility due to global developments. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain orderly and supportive of economic growth. The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Importantly, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and surplus in the  1/2  11/21/2020  current account of the balance of payments. Bank Negara Malaysia’s monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity.

The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 3.00 percent and 3.50 percent respectively.  The global economy has strengthened further, with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across regions. Global trade continues to sustain strong growth performance. In the advanced economies, diminishing labour market slack and additional policy support will provide further impetus to growth. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Globally, financial markets have remained stable. Global growth is projected to experience a faster expansion in 2018. In this environment, risks to the global growth outlook are more balanced, pointing towards continuity in the current phase of global economic expansion.  For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators reaffirm the strength in exports and domestic activity. Looking ahead, the strong growth momentum is expected to continue in 2018, sustained by the stronger global growth and positive spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions. The outlook for investment activity is also positive, driven by new and on-going infrastructure projects and capital spending by both export- and domestic-oriented firms. The external sector will provide additional impetus to the economy. Overall, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018.  Headline inflation averaged at 3.7% in 2017. Inflation is expected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, remains moderate.  The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity.  1/2  11/21/2020  With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to normalise the degree of monetary accommodation.
